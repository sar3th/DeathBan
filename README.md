DeathBan
========

DeathBan is a plugin for Bukkit that automatically bans players after death for a configurable amount of time.

Development Status
------------------

Right now, the plugin is still in early development.
Here is a list of working things :)

_Commands_:

* db-settime
* db-ban

_Internal features_:

* killing people
* setting bantime

Compiling and debugging
-----------------------
Create a _lib_ folder and put _bukkit-1.2.3-R0.2.jar_ and _craftbukkit-1.2.3-R0.2.jar_ in it, then open the project using NetBeans.

Notes:

* Before debugging, run "_Clean and Build_" to automatically copy the jar to the right place.
* Running _Clean_ will delete the plugin and its settings from the debug folder.
* Running _Build_ will build the jar and copy it to debug/plugins.
* Bukkit is required for compiling and CraftBukkit is only used for debugging.

Credits, Greetings and Thanks
-----------------------------
DeathBan has been heavily influenced by [DeathTimeout](https://github.com/Zelif/DeathTimeout) by [Zelif](https://github.com/Zelif). I tried fixing it first, but I failed miserably, so I decided to rewrite it from scratch instead of forking it.

Greetings fly out to Bukkit developers! Hai =D

A very special "thank you" goes out to my friend [Gizmokid2005](https://github.com/Gizmokid2005) (not only) for requesting this. You are awesome :D
