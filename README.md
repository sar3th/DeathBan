DeathBan
========

DeathBan is a plugin for Bukkit that automatically bans players after death for a configurable amount of time.

Development Status
------------------

Right now, the plugin is still in early development. I will add more info as it progresses.


Credits, Greetings and Thanks
------------------
DeathBan has been heavily influenced by [DeathTimeout](https://github.com/Zelif/DeathTimeout) by [Zelif](https://github.com/Zelif). I tried fixing it first, but I failed miserably, so I decided to rewrite it from scratch instead of forking it.

Greetings fly out to Bukkit developers! Hai =D

A very special "thank you" goes out to my friend [Gizmokid2005](https://github.com/Gizmokid2005) (not only) for requesting this. You are awesome :D
